# PredDBP-Stack
DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) play vital roles in all aspects of genetic activity. However, identification of DBPs by using wet-lab experimental approaches is often time-consuming and laborious. In this study, we develop a novel computational method, called PredDBP-Stack, to predict DBPs solely based on their primary sequences. First, amino acid composition (AAC) and transition probability composition (TPC) extracted from the hidden markov model (HMM) profile are adopted to represent a protein. Next, we establish a stacked ensemble model to identify DBPs, which involves two stages of learning. In the first stage, the four base-classifiers are trained with the feature of HMM-based compositions. In the second stage, the prediction probabilities of these base-classifiers are used as inputs to the meta-classifier. Based on the PDB1075 benchmark dataset, we conduct a jackknife cross validation with the proposed PredDBP-Stack predictor and obtain a balanced sensitivity and specificity of 92.47% and 86.56%, repectively. This outcome outperforms most of the existing classifiers. Furthermore, our method also achieves superior performance and model robustness on the PDB186 independent dataset. This demonstrates that the PredDBP-Stack is an effective classifier for accurately identifying DBPs based on protein sequence information alone.
